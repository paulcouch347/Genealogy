Running the Program: To execute the program, compile it using make run which
	will execute it with data.txt as input. After that it can be executed
	from the command line as ./genealogy < input-file.txt. If it is run
	 without a text file redirected as the standard input, the user will
	 be able to input commands as long as the program is running.
Purpose: The program takes a text file of formatted comands from standard 
	input and builds a bipartite graph that represents a family tree.
	It uses a Breadth-first search algorithim to find the shortest
	relationship between two people, and it checks the data for
	consistency, such as if Person 2 has parent Family 3 then Person 2
	is a child in Family 3.
Limitations: The program should always be run with a text file passed in
	from standard input. If a file isn't passed in, the program doesn't
	have a built-in way to exit.
Outside Help: None
